# Tic-Tac-Toe
A game of Tic-Tac-Toe played in the browser against an AI opponent. Built with
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Instructions
To start playing the player will click on a square where they would like to place their
first '*X*'. The CPU will then place an *'O'* in a vacant square. Next the
player will pick another vacant square to place their next '*X*'.

This process continues until a chain of '*O's'*' or '*X's*' are formed. A blue
line will be drawn across the winning letters indicating the winner.

After a short delay the game will reset and is ready for another round.

# Installation/Run
Tic-Tac-Toe can be run from https://eugene-l-h.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/ or by
downloading the files and opening the index.html file in the browser of your
choice. 

This project was developed to be functional scaling from mobile to desktop
environments. 

# Notes
Some Learning Outcomes:
- I was pressed to learn more about scaling from mobile to desktop with is this
project; a topic I find quite challenging as I find myself needing to learn more
and more about CSS. Styling doesn't seem to come as naturally to me as
programming logic and JavaScript.

- I had an enjoyable time programming an AI that had to analyze the conditions
  of the board and make decisions based on what if found.
